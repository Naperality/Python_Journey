# 🐍 My Python Learning Journey

Welcome to my Python learning roadmap! This repository is a structured collection of exercises, projects, and notes as I train to become a software engineer. My goal is to strengthen my programming skills using Python and prepare for coding interviews at companies like Accenture, IBM, and more.

## 💡 Why I Created This
I want to:
- Practice Python consistently
- Build real projects from scratch
- Prepare for coding interviews and software developer roles
- Track my growth from beginner to expert

## 🚀 What's Next
- ✅ Week 1: Master Python basics
- ⏳ Week 2–4: Start solving easy problems on LeetCode
- 🔜 Add new mini projects every week
