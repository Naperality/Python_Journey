# 🟢 Beginner Level – Python Fundamentals

This folder contains my foundational Python exercises and mini-projects. I'm focusing on building a strong grasp of the **core concepts** that every Python developer must know.

## 📚 Topics Covered

- ✅ Variables and Data Types
- ✅ Input and Output (`input()`, `print()`)
- ✅ Conditional Statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- ✅ Loops (`for`, `while`, `break`, `continue`)
- ✅ Functions and Return Values
- ✅ Strings and List Manipulation
- ✅ Dictionaries and Sets
- ✅ File I/O (basic reading and writing)

## 🎯 Learning Goals

By completing this level, I aim to:

- Write clean, readable Python code
- Break down problems using basic logic and flow control
- Get comfortable with using the terminal and running scripts
- Start building confidence to solve coding interview problems
