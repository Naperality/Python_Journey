# 📝 Student Manager – Beginner Python Project

This is a beginner-friendly **Python command-line app** that allows you to manage student records. It’s built using only core Python concepts — no external libraries needed!

This project is part of my [Beginner Python Journey](../README.md) where I apply the foundational programming skills I’ve learned.

## 🚀 Features

- ➕ Add new students
- 📋 View all students
- 🔍 Search for a student by name
- ❌ Remove a student
- 💾 Save data to a file (`students.txt`)
- 📂 Load data from a file

| Variables & Data Types | Store student name, age, course |
| Input/Output | Get user input and display results |
| Conditional Statements | Menu options and flow |
| Loops | Keep the menu running |
