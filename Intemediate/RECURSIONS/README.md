# Recursion in Python

This folder demonstrates classic problems solved using recursion. Each script includes a recursive approach along with comments for clarity.

## Contents

- `01_factorial.py` - Recursive computation of factorials
- `02_fibonacci.py` - Recursive generation of Fibonacci numbers
- `03_permutations.py` - Generating all permutations of a list/string recursively
- `README.md` - Documentation for this folder

## Purpose

Recursion is a fundamental concept in computer science. These examples aim to build an intuition for recursive problem-solving.
