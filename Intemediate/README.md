# 🟡 Intermediate Level – Python Problem Solving & Projects

This folder contains my **intermediate-level Python practice**, focusing on data structures, algorithms, recursion, and building useful mini-projects. This stage builds on the fundamentals and prepares me for technical interviews and real-world coding scenarios.

---

## 📚 Topics Covered

- ✅ Data Structures (Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs)
- ✅ Recursion & Backtracking
- ✅ Searching & Sorting Algorithms
- ✅ Problem-solving with time/space complexity
- ✅ Mini Python applications using core logic

## 🎯 Learning Goals

By completing this level, I aim to:

- Deepen my understanding of Python’s data structures and algorithms
- Solve problems with better time/space complexity
- Prepare for technical interviews (e.g., Accenture ASE, IBM, Cognizant)
- Translate logic into real-world apps and tools
